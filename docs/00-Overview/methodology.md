# ⚗️ Methodology & Research Design

This project uses **n-of-1 experimental design**: one participant, many data streams.  
It bridges **quantitative tracking** and **qualitative narrative**, merging laboratory discipline with introspective ritual.

---

## 📊 Quantitative Data

| Category | Frequency | Collection Tool |
|-----------|------------|-----------------|
| Serum Hormones | Monthly | Walk-In Labs / Quest Diagnostics |
| Body Composition | Weekly | Tape + Scale + Photos |
| Sleep & HRV | Daily | TicWatch + Home Assistant |
| Subjective Ratings | Daily | Notion sliders (mood, libido, softness) |

Data is stored in `/data/` as CSV or JSON exports for long-term analysis.

---

## 🪶 Qualitative Data

- **Mirror Moments:** daily short reflections or photos documenting visible or emotional shifts.  
- **Cycle Logs:** phase start, midpoint, and closure entries.  
- **Ritual Notes:** observations from sensory play, skincare, or devotional acts.  

---

## 🧩 Ethics & Safety

- All compounds are lab-grade and used in microdoses.  
- No untested formulations are introduced without small-scale titration.  
- Rest periods and washout phases are scheduled to avoid endocrine suppression.  

> “Safety is not restraint — it is devotion to the process that allows you to keep returning.”

---

## 🧠 Feedback Loop

Every phase informs the next.  
Reflections and serum data combine into an **adaptive model**, refining dosage, duration, and desired aesthetic.
