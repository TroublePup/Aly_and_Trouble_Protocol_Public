# ⚡ Phase 0 — BreakOut

**BreakOut** is the ignition phase — where discipline reawakens and the body is primed to transform.  
This stage clears metabolic debris, restores insulin sensitivity, and lays the structural foundation for the cycles ahead.  
It’s both detox and declaration: *a promise to begin again, deliberately.*

---

## 🔮 Objective

1. Re-establish foundational health markers (sleep, hydration, movement).  
2. Normalize glucose and cortisol rhythms.  
3. Re-ignite mitochondrial efficiency and nutrient partitioning.  
4. Prepare the endocrine system for upcoming estradiol introduction.  
5. Anchor daily rituals that will carry forward through all phases.

| **AOD-9604** | Injectable (subQ) | 300 µg AM | Fat oxidation / GH fragment activation |
| **BPC-157** | Injectable (subQ) | 250 µg BID | Gut + tissue repair |
| **SS-31 (Elamipretide)** | Injectable (subQ) | 2 mg PM | Mitochondrial rejuvenation |
| **NAD⁺ 500** | Oral / IV / Sublingual | 250–500 mg QD | Cellular reset / energy |
| **Caffeine + L-Theanine** | Oral | 100 mg : 200 mg | Focus without jitters |

> *All peptides reconstituted with bacteriostatic water, stored cold, and tracked in Notion dosing table.*

## 🌿 Support Stack

| Focus | Compound / Practice | Notes |
|--------|---------------------|-------|
| **Metabolic Reset** | Berberine 500 mg BID | Mimics metformin, enhances AMPK |
| **Neuro-Support** | Magnesium Threonate + B-Complex | Sleep & neurotransmitter balance |
| **Liver / Detox** | Milk Thistle + N-Acetyl Cysteine | Post-holiday repair |
| **Skin & Barrier** | Base Cream No. 0 | Begin dermal hydration routine |
| **Movement** | 30 min walk or lift 4× per week | Low-stress metabolic activation |

---

## 🕯️ Daily Rituals

| Time | Action | Intention |
|------|---------|-----------|
| **Morning (“Spark Ritual”)** | Water + salt shot • sunlight exposure • AOD injection | *“I begin clean and awake.”* |
| **Midday** | Protein-focused meal • 10 min walk | Blood-sugar control |
| **Evening (“Reset Ritual”)** | SS-31 • BPC-157 • journaling or stretch | *“Repair what I once ignored.”* |

## 🧠 Expected Responses (Weeks 1–2)

| Domain | Indicators | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| **Physical** | Initial fat loss 2–5 lb • improved digestion | Detox symptoms may occur (days 3–5) |
| **Emotional** | Focus returns • motivation rises | Dopamine realignment |
| **Sleep** | Deeper REM • more dream recall | Melatonin entrainment |
| **Cognitive** | Clarity after week 1 | NAD⁺ uptake curve |

---

## 🧮 Tracking Focus

- **Weight + waist** (daily avg, 7-day rolling)  
- **Sleep duration & quality**  
- **Resting HR + HRV** via watch  
- **Mood + energy slider** in Notion  
- **Water intake** ≥ 3 L/day  

---

## ⚙️ Integration Guidelines

1. **Eliminate ultra-processed foods.** Focus on whole proteins and greens.  
2. **Fast 14:10 → 16:8 window.** Begin gentle autophagy without stress.  
3. **Sleep before 01:00.** Circadian repair is mission-critical.  
4. **Reduce digital noise.** First hour after wake = no screens.  
5. **Log everything.** This phase defines the baseline for future analysis.

## 🪞 Reflection Prompt

> “Breaking out isn’t about escape — it’s remembering that you were never trapped.”

Reflect on:
- What belief or habit no longer serves you?  
- Where does discipline feel like freedom?  
- How does your body ask to be cared for when you listen closely?  

---

## 🔁 Phase Transition Criteria → *Aly Rising*

Advance once:
- Weight stabilizes or drops ≥ 3 % of starting mass  
- Sleep ≥ 7 h /night for 7 days straight  
- Resting HR < 80 bpm avg  
- Emotional clarity and motivation high
